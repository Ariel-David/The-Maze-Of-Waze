# The-Maze-Of-Waze
In this project we will use the infrastructure of assignment 2 (data structure and algorithms for weighted tuning).    
The main goal of the assignment is to develop logic for a computer game where a group of robots must
perform movement tasks ("coin collecting") on a weighted graph.                                                               
Given a weighted graph on its sides placed a collection of coins (represented as heresies)                                       
We want to place a group of robots of a specified size, and for each robot
to do real-time traffic planning so that at the end of the mission
the total "coins" that all the robots collect together will be maximum.

Prerequisites:                                                                             
JDK 13.0.1
Eclipse or some other IDE
